        <h2>The Best Fighting Game of 2014</h2>
        
        <hr>
    
        <p class="dropcap">Killer Instinct is a fighting game in the Killer Instinct series, developed by Double Helix Games and Rare under supervision of Ken Lobb. The game was announced during Microsoft's E3 2013 press event, and was released exclusively as a launch game for the Xbox One on November 22, 2013.</p>
        
        <p><em>Killer Instinct</em> is a return to the series which retains its traditional combo-based gameplay. The main mechanic of combos is the <em>Auto-Double</em> (button presses following special attacks will create automatic combo hits instead of each individual hit requiring player input). A signature feature of Killer Instinct, the Ultra Combo, is included (an Ultra Combo is an automatic combo that can only be done to end a match and consists of a long string of attacks). <em>Combo Breakers</em> also return (attacks that, when timed properly, can stop a combo), with the new addition of <em>Counter Breakers</em> (the ability to reverse a Combo Breaker into a "Lockout" instead, the failure state of a Combo Breaker which prevents another breaker attempt for three seconds). A two-segmented super meter enables the use of <em>Shadow</em> moves that have upgraded hit properties and can cause more damage/combo hits.
A notable new feature to the Killer Instinct gameplay is the addition of <em>Instinct Mode</em>. By filling up a secondary bar beneath the character's lifebar, each character can trigger a unique enhancement for a limited period (so for instance Glacius can cover himself in ice armor for better damage resistance or Thunder's dash becomes invincible and moves farther). The enhancements are built around complementing the character's playstyle traits. Instinct Mode can be used to perform an instantaneous cancel during a combo and also reset the <em>knockdown value</em> (a meter that appears during a combo that determines how close the engine is to automatically ending a combo). Instinct Mode can also be used to stop an Ultra Combo in order to chain it to other moves and even into another Ultra for an even more stylish finish than a simple Ultra Combo can provide.</p>
<p>The game features the ability to unlock and use classic Killer Instinct music and costumes in place of their updated counterparts. Chris Sutherland, the announcer from the first two Killer Instinct titles, also appears as an optional announcer available for use.[6] The game uses Kinect's facial recognition software to save players' personalized game settings.</p>

        <h2>Plot</h2>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>The game is set several years after the events of <em>Killer Instinct 2</em>. Each character has their own story-arc in the game; a story mode featuring campaigns for each character will be released in March.</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li><em>Jago</em> is suffering a crisis of faith following the discovery that the Tiger Spirit guiding him was actually <em>Gargos</em>.</li>
            <li><em>Sabrewulf</em> has submitted to his feral side and torn out his cybernetic implants, restoring his arms through the use of dark arts.</li>
            <li><em>Glacius</em> has resolved to recover and use his lost alien technology for the benefit of Earth.</li>
            <li><em>Thunder</em>, having learned that his brother <em>Eagle</em> was killed in the first <em>Killer Instinct</em> tournament but not knowing how or why, resorts to making something of an alliance with a not-so-familiar face in order to obtain the information he seeks and finally receive closure.</li>
            <li><em>Sadira</em> and her assassins are on a mission, hunting the other competitors for bloodsport.</li>
            <li><em>Orchid</em>, for reasons unknown as of now, has been disavowed by her agency. Despite their apparent destruction at her hands, <em>Orchid</em> believes that <em>UltraTech</em> is still active, and fully commits herself to finding and eliminating what remains of them. To accomplish this, she has emigrated to a different part of the world to establish a rebel group. She also apparently suffers from paranoia to some extent.</li>
            <li><em>Spinal</em>, once again resurrected and armed with a new living shield, seeks to remove the curse causing his immortality so that he might finally rest in peace.</li>
        </ul>

            <p><em>Glacius</em> is an ice-like being from a planet far away from Earth. His reason for coming to Earth is also connected to <em>Ultratech</em>. It seems as if the company has also captured others of his species. His mission would become fruitless however, because due to a malfunction in his ship's systems, he crash-landed on Earth. Unfortunately for him, he was also recovered by none other than <em>Ultratech</em>. The tyranical company held him captive until their next <em>Killer Instinct</em> tournament and informed him they would let him go...if he fought for his life in the tournament. They wanted to prove that it was the human race that was the superior one.</p>

            <p><em>Shadow Jago</em> is a character introduced in <em>Killer Instinct</em> for <strong>Xbox One</strong> as a character given to players who purchased a <strong>Day One 12-month Xbox Live membership card</strong>. He is an (presumably) evil version of <em>Jago</em>, but utilizes the same moveset as him.</p>
            
            <p>In appearance, <em>Shadow Jago</em> is identical to <em>Jago</em> except for a few key changes. His skin is pale blue, he has pupil-less eyes, has chains in place of rope wrapped around his torso, and various articles of clothing are tattered. His facemask is also stylized after a skeletal jaw in the mouth area.</p>
            
            <p>Although his moveset is identical to <em>Jago's</em>, the visual effects are differed in order to reflect <em>Shadow Jago</em> better (the <em>fire</em> in <em>Jago's</em> <strong>Endokuken</strong> is changed to a <em>black, shadowy effect</em>, etc.).</p>
            
            <p>His voice is also more <strong>sinister</strong> than <em>Jago's</em>. Even though his voice is different, both <em>Jagos</em> share the same quotes.</p>
